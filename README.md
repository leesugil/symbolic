# symbolic
Symbolic calculator for arithmetic operations with fractions

## Updates
- Can accept symbolic variables with/without assigned values.
- Can display them in a fraction.

## Future Updates
- Can display current inputs.
- Can reduce fractions.
- Can apply values to variables for computation.
- Can display arithmetic operations ('+', '-', '\*', '/')
- Can scanf the "x = 1.2e-3" forms.
- Can parse line string inputs such as "G M m / r^2"
- Can parse equations of the form "F = G M m / r^2"
- Can reduce equations.

## Target Input Forms
- x = 5, y = 6
- f(x, y) = x^2 + y
- f(x, y) == g(x, y, z)
